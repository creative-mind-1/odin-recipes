        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>These mini apple pies are so fun to make! You can use different types of apples and give some of them a lattice crust. They're delicious as-is or served warm with ice cream. Let everyone select their favorite! This recipe uses Granny Smith apples. I bought the mini pie dishes online.</p>

            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut four 6-inch rounds out of the pie crusts, and fit them into four 5-inch mini pie dishes. Cut remaining pie crust into 1/8-inch strips, and set dough aside.</li>
            <li>Mix diced apple, tapioca, sugar, lemon juice, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a bowl until thoroughly combined; allow mixture to stand for 5 minutes to soften the tapioca. Stir mixture again, and spoon into prepared pie shells. Use the strips of dough to weave a small lattice crust on top of each pie, and pinch the strips onto the bottom crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the pies are golden brown and apple filling is bubbling, about 30 minutes. Cool before serving.</li>
        </ol>
